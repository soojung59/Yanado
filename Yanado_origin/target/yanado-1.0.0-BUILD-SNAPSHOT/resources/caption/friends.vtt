00:00:45.893 --> 00:00:48.281
There's nothing to tell.
It's just some guy I work with.

00:00:48.952 --> 00:00:51.162
You're going out with the guy.

00:00:51.383 --> 00:00:52.515
There has to be something
wrong with him.

00:00:53.955 --> 00:00:55.343
So does he have a hump
and a hairpiece?

00:00:57.746 --> 00:00:59.003
Wait, does he eat chalk?

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.058
I don't want her to go through
what I did with Carl.

00:01:04.021 --> 00:01:04.407
Okay, everybody relax.

00:01:05.207 --> 00:01:06.412
This is not even a date.

00:01:06.938 --> 00:01:09.146
It's just two people going out
to dinner and not having sex.

00:01:09.852 --> 00:01:10.764
Sounds like a date to me.

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:16.208
I'm in high school,
in the cafeteria..

00:01:17.449 --> 00:01:19.437
and I realize I'm totally naked.

00:01:20.673 --> 00:01:21.568
I've had that dream.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.165
Then I look down and I realize
there is a phone...

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:27.525
there.

00:01:29.136 --> 00:01:30.396
- Instead of
- That's right!

00:01:31.472 --> 00:01:32.253
Never had that one.

00:01:33.215 --> 00:01:35.038
All of a sudden,
the phone starts to ring.

00:01:37.192 --> 00:01:38.197
And it turns out it's my mother.

00:01:39.511 --> 00:01:43.841
Which is very, very weird
because she never calls me.

00:01:52.165 --> 00:01:53.582
He says, "Hello,"
I want to kill myself.

00:01:55.721 --> 00:01:56.396
You okay?

00:01:57.164 --> 00:01:58.635
I feel like someone pulled my
intestine out of my mouth...

00:01:59.673 --> 00:02:03.190
and tied it around my neck.
- Cookie?

00:02:05.947 --> 00:02:06.892
Carol moved her stuff out today.

00:02:08.067 --> 00:02:09.536
- Let me get you some coffee.
- Thanks.

00:02:14.476 --> 00:02:17.906
No, don't!
Stop cleansing my aura.

00:02:19.687 --> 00:02:21.440
- Just leave my aura alone, okay?
- Fine, be murky.

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:26.213
- I'll be fine. I hope she'll be happy.

00:02:27.086 --> 00:02:27.400
No, you don't.

00:02:28.156 --> 00:02:28.470
To hell with her. She left me!

00:02:31.242 --> 00:02:32.455
And you never knew she was a lesbian.

00:02:36.392 --> 00:02:40.609
Why does everyone
keep fixating on that?

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:44.640
She didn't know.
How should I know?

00:02:47.773 --> 00:02:49.321
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.

00:02:51.783 --> 00:02:52.776
Did I say that out loud?

00:02:55.748 --> 00:02:58.917
Look, you're feeling
a lot of pain right now.

00:02:59.915 --> 00:03:01.082
You're angry. You're hurting.

00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:02.793
Can I tell you what
the answer is?

00:03:04.771 --> 00:03:05.542
Strip joints!

00:03:10.515 --> 00:03:11.981
See, but I don't want
to be single, okay?

00:03:12.875 --> 00:03:14.552
I just want to be married again.

00:03:19.124 --> 00:03:21.217
And I just want a million dollars!

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:24.672
Rachel?

00:03:25.383 --> 00:03:28.203
Oh, God, Monica!
Hi! Thank God!

00:03:28.955 --> 00:03:29.636
I went to your building and
this guy with a hammer said...

00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:31.369
...that you might be here and you are.

00:03:33.668 --> 00:03:34.987
-Can I get you some coffee?
-Decaf.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.698
Everybody, this is Rachel,
another Lincoln High survivor.

00:03:41.703 --> 00:03:43.979
This is everybody.
Chandler and Phoebe..

00:03:44.841 --> 00:03:46.399
...and Joey. And remember
my brother, Ross?

00:03:47.211 --> 00:03:47.464
Sure!

00:03:56.832 --> 00:03:59.735
You want to tell us now, or are we
waiting for four wet bridesmaids?

00:04:02.277 --> 00:04:05.465
Oh, God! Well, it started about
a half-hour before the wedding.

00:04:07.196 --> 00:04:08.905
I was in this room with
all the presents...

00:04:10.046 --> 00:04:14.236
This really gorgeous
Limoges gravy boat.

00:04:14.976 --> 00:04:15.462
When all of a sudden I realize...

00:04:16.825 --> 00:04:16.990
Sweet 'N Low?

00:04:17.438 --> 00:04:19.655
I realized...

00:04:20.583 --> 00:04:21.314
...I was more turned on by
this gravy boat than by Barry.

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:24.060
And then I really freaked out,
when it hit me:

00:04:25.172 --> 00:04:27.581
How much Barry looks like
Mr. Potato Head.

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:30.460
I always knew he looked
familiar, but. . . .

00:04:34.036 --> 00:04:37.638
I had to get out of there,
and I started wondering. . .

00:04:38.213 --> 00:04:39.606
. . . ''Why am I doing this?''
and ''Who am I doing this for?''

00:04:41.108 --> 00:04:44.625
I didn't know where to go, and I know
you and I have drifted apart. . .

00:04:45.765 --> 00:04:47.928
. . .but you're the only person
I know in the city.

00:04:48.875 --> 00:04:50.147
Who wasn't asked to the wedding.

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:52.488
I was kind of hoping that
wouldn't be an issue.

00:05:07.393 --> 00:05:09.019
I guess he bought her
the pipe organ. . .

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:10.759
. . .and she's really not
happy about it.

00:05:13.296 --> 00:05:16.537
Daddy, I just--
I can't marry him.

00:05:16.962 --> 00:05:17.676
I'm sorry.

00:05:18.394 --> 00:05:19.321
I just don't love him.

00:05:20.747 --> 00:05:22.693
Well, it matters to me!

00:05:26.241 --> 00:05:28.594
She should not be
wearing those pants.

00:05:29.168 --> 00:05:31.298
I say push her down the stairs!

00:05:32.258 --> 00:05:35.486
Push her down the stairs!
Push her down the stairs!

00:05:38.637 --> 00:05:41.336
Come on, Daddy, listen!

00:05:41.697 --> 00:05:44.359
All my life, everyone's
always told me, ''You're a shoe! ''

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.357
''You're a shoe! You're a shoe!
You're a shoe! ''

00:05:47.966 --> 00:05:50.446
I stopped and said,
''What if I don't wanna be a shoe?

00:05:51.245 --> 00:05:53.733
What if I want to be a purse?

00:05:54.256 --> 00:05:55.266
Or a hat?''

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:59.297
I don't want you to buy me a hat,
I--

00:05:59.737 --> 00:06:00.697
It's a metaphor, Daddy!

00:06:02.861 --> 00:06:04.517
You can see where he'd have trouble.

00:06:08.066 --> 00:06:09.803
Look, Daddy, it's my life.

00:06:11.556 --> 00:06:13.363
Well, maybe I'll just stay
here with Monica.

00:06:16.344 --> 00:06:18.717
I guess we've established
she's staying with Monica.

00:06:20.874 --> 00:06:22.488
Well, maybe that's my decision.

00:06:23.985 --> 00:06:25.623
Well, maybe I don't need your money.

00:06:26.607 --> 00:06:27.860
Wait! Wait! I said maybe!

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:37.040
Just breathe.
Breathe, that's it.

00:06:37.782 --> 00:06:39.481
Just try to think
of nice, calm things.

00:06:40.276 --> 00:06:41.878
Raindrops on roses
And whiskers on kittens

00:06:42.787 --> 00:06:44.709
Doorbells and sleigh bells
And something with mittens

00:06:45.391 --> 00:06:47.832
La la la something
And noodles with string

00:06:52.848 --> 00:06:53.161
-These are a--
-I'm all better now.

00:06:55.821 --> 00:06:56.588
I helped.

00:06:59.491 --> 00:07:01.088
This is probably for
the best, you know?

00:07:01.796 --> 00:07:03.660
Independence.
Taking control of your life.

00:07:04.557 --> 00:07:08.042
If you need anything,
you can always come to Joey.

00:07:08.825 --> 00:07:11.726
Me and Chandler live across the hall.
And he's away a lot.

00:07:13.871 --> 00:07:15.971
Joey, stop hitting on her!
It's her wedding day.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:18.070
What? Like there's
a rule or something?

00:07:20.885 --> 00:07:23.098
Please don't do that again.
It's a horrible sound.

00:07:24.399 --> 00:07:25.707
It's Paul.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.030
Buzz him in.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:27.769
-Who's Paul?
-Paul, the wine guy?

00:07:28.842 --> 00:07:30.075
Maybe.

00:07:30.607 --> 00:07:33.484
Your ''not a real date,''
is with Paul, the wine guy?

00:07:33.966 --> 00:07:34.904
He finally asked you out?

00:07:35.248 --> 00:07:37.131
It's a ''Dear Diary'' moment.

00:07:39.134 --> 00:07:41.161
Rach, I can cancel.

00:07:41.491 --> 00:07:42.494
Oh, God. Please, no.
Go, I'll be fine.

00:07:42.899 --> 00:07:44.712
Ross are you okay?
Do you want me to stay?

00:07:46.366 --> 00:07:47.613
That'd be good.

00:07:49.454 --> 00:07:51.758
-Really?
-Go on! It's Paul, the wine guy!

00:07:56.089 --> 00:07:58.358
Hi, come in! Paul, this is. . .

00:07:59.047 --> 00:08:01.981
. . .everybody.
Everybody, this is Paul.

00:08:02.711 --> 00:08:07.046
-The wine guy.
-I didn't catch your name. Paul?

00:08:08.418 --> 00:08:09.523
Change. Sit down.
Two seconds.

00:08:13.819 --> 00:08:16.605
I just pulled out four eyelashes.
That can't be good.

00:08:19.661 --> 00:08:21.328
Rachel, what are you
up to tonight?

00:08:22.276 --> 00:08:25.981
I was supposed to be headed
for Aruba on my honeymoon. . .

00:08:26.436 --> 00:08:27.716
. . .so, nothing.

00:08:29.371 --> 00:08:31.169
Right. You're not even
getting your honeymoon.

00:08:31.766 --> 00:08:36.309
Although, Aruba. This time of year?
Talk about your. . .

00:08:38.262 --> 00:08:39.300
. . .big lizards.

00:08:43.951 --> 00:08:45.862
If you don't feel
like being alone tonight. . .

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.278
. . .Joey and Chandler are
helping me with my furniture.

00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:51.515
And we're very excited about it.

00:08:53.037 --> 00:08:56.617
Thanks. But I'm just gonna
hang out here.

00:08:57.279 --> 00:08:59.058
-It's been a long day.
-Okay. Sure.

00:08:59.455 --> 00:09:00.795
Pheebs, wanna help?

00:09:01.228 --> 00:09:01.844
I wish I could, but I don't want to.

00:09:09.794 --> 00:09:12.734
I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y
thing to the side things. . .

00:09:13.264 --> 00:09:16.207
. . .using a bunch of these
little worm guys.

00:09:17.895 --> 00:09:21.449
I have no bracket-y thing.
I see no worm guys whatsoever. . .

00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:25.592
. . .and I cannot feel my legs.

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:29.794
-Which goes where?
-I have no idea.

00:09:32.972 --> 00:09:34.459
-Done with the bookcase.
-All finished.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.207
This was Carol's favorite beer.

00:09:42.578 --> 00:09:44.674
She always drank it out of the can.
I should have known.

00:09:46.623 --> 00:09:47.812
Let me ask you a question.

00:09:48.227 --> 00:09:51.483
She got the furniture,
the stereo, the good TV.

00:09:52.485 --> 00:09:53.337
What did you get?

00:09:54.483 --> 00:09:55.196
You guys.

00:09:55.588 --> 00:09:56.775
-You got screwed.
-Oh, my God.

00:09:57.181 --> 00:10:00.355
-Oh, my God.
-I know. I'm such an idiot.

00:10:01.658 --> 00:10:05.437
I should've caught on when she went to
the dentist four and five times a week.

00:10:06.343 --> 00:10:07.826
I mean, how clean can teeth get?

00:10:08.445 --> 00:10:11.236
My brother's going through that.
He's a mess.

00:10:11.575 --> 00:10:12.222
How did you get through it?

00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:16.661
He might try accidentally breaking
something valuable of hers.

00:10:17.134 --> 00:10:18.019
-Say her--
-Leg?

00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:21.512
That's one way of going through it.
Me, I went for the watch.

00:10:21.976 --> 00:10:23.762
You actually broke her watch?

00:10:24.439 --> 00:10:27.298
Barry, I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.

00:10:28.018 --> 00:10:31.832
You probably think it's about making
love with your socks on, but it isn't.

00:10:32.195 --> 00:10:34.549
It's about me.
And I just--

00:10:41.853 --> 00:10:43.652
Machine cut me off again.
Anyway. . . .

00:10:46.796 --> 00:10:50.692
You know what's scary? What if there
is only one woman for everybody?

00:10:51.335 --> 00:10:53.382
I mean, what if you get one
woman, and that's it?

00:10:54.602 --> 00:10:58.247
Unfortunately, in my case,
there was only one woman for her.

00:10:59.779 --> 00:11:01.613
What are you talking about?
One woman.

00:11:02.984 --> 00:11:05.633
That's like saying there's only
one flavor of ice cream for you.

00:11:07.046 --> 00:11:09.733
Let me tell you something.
There's lots of flavors out there.

00:11:10.331 --> 00:11:14.826
Rocky road, and cookie dough,
and bing cherry vanilla.

00:11:15.493 --> 00:11:18.372
You can get them with jimmies,
or nuts, or whipped cream.

00:11:19.517 --> 00:11:21.946
This is the best thing that
ever happened to you!

00:11:22.677 --> 00:11:25.367
You got married. You were
like, what? Eight?

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:30.102
Welcome back to the world.
Grab a spoon!

00:11:31.495 --> 00:11:33.808
I honestly don't know
if I'm hungry or horny.

00:11:34.687 --> 00:11:35.815
Then stay out of my freezer.

00:11:39.101 --> 00:11:41.757
Ever since she
walked out on me, I. . . .

00:11:42.642 --> 00:11:45.944
What? What?

00:11:46.332 --> 00:11:47.145
You wanna spell it out with noodles?

00:11:47.549 --> 00:11:50.092
It's more of a fifth date
kind of revelation.

00:11:50.875 --> 00:11:53.555
So there's going to be a fifth date?

00:11:54.867 --> 00:11:55.944
Isn't there?

00:11:57.283 --> 00:11:58.664
Yeah, yeah. I think there is.

00:12:00.376 --> 00:12:01.657
What were you going to say?

00:12:04.219 --> 00:12:08.482
Ever since she left me. . .

00:12:10.528 --> 00:12:12.375
. . .I haven't been able to perform. . .

00:12:14.082 --> 00:12:14.794
. . .sexually.

00:12:17.888 --> 00:12:18.999
Oh, God! Oh, God!

00:12:19.457 --> 00:12:21.590
I'm so sorry.

00:12:21.902 --> 00:12:23.336
Being spit on is probably
not what you need right now.

00:12:26.918 --> 00:12:27.617
How long?

00:12:28.144 --> 00:12:29.063
Two years.

00:12:29.933 --> 00:12:34.117
I'm glad you smashed her watch.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:39.383
So you still think you might
want that fifth date?

00:12:42.017 --> 00:12:44.549
Yeah, I do.

00:12:52.064 --> 00:12:57.754
But Joanie loved Chachi.
That's the difference.

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:01.745
''Grab a spoon. ''

00:13:02.304 --> 00:13:04.127
Do you know long it's been
since I grabbed a spoon?

00:13:05.208 --> 00:13:07.358
Do the words, ''Billy, don't be a
hero,'' mean anything to you?

00:13:09.912 --> 00:13:13.328
You know, here's the thing. Even if
I could get it together enough. . .

00:13:13.901 --> 00:13:15.475
. . .to ask a woman out. . .

00:13:17.235 --> 00:13:18.273
. . .who am I going to ask?

00:13:39.769 --> 00:13:40.195
Isn't this amazing?

00:13:40.878 --> 00:13:42.980
I have never made coffee
before in my life.

00:13:43.763 --> 00:13:45.751
-That is amazing.
-Congratulations.

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:49.290
If you feel like you gotta make
a Western omelet or something. . . .

00:13:53.228 --> 00:13:55.429
Although, actually
I'm really not that hungry.

00:13:57.904 --> 00:13:58.922
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

00:14:01.522 --> 00:14:03.412
-Morning.
-Morning, Paul.

00:14:04.049 --> 00:14:05.943
-Hello, Paul.
-Hi. Paul, is it?

00:14:11.064 --> 00:14:12.099
Last night was like. . .

00:14:13.256 --> 00:14:14.882
-Thank you so much.

00:14:16.132 --> 00:14:17.138
We'll talk later.

00:14:23.097 --> 00:14:24.047
Thank you.

00:14:30.734 --> 00:14:31.956
That wasn't a real date.

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:35.641
What the hell do you do
on a real date?

00:14:37.467 --> 00:14:39.006
Shut up and put my table back.

00:14:41.129 --> 00:14:42.664
I've got to get to work.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:46.880
If I don't input those numbers,
it doesn't make much of a difference.

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:53.198
So, like, you guys all have jobs?

00:14:54.152 --> 00:14:55.470
Yeah, we all have jobs.

00:14:56.297 --> 00:14:58.030
That's how we buy stuff.

00:14:59.787 --> 00:15:00.697
Yeah, I'm an actor.

00:15:01.563 --> 00:15:03.911
Have I seen you in anything?

00:15:04.343 --> 00:15:05.917
I doubt it.
Mostly regional work.

00:15:06.383 --> 00:15:09.429
Unless you happen to catch the
Wee One's production of Pinocchio...

00:15:09.969 --> 00:15:12.148
''Look, Geppeto. I'm a real live boy. ''

00:15:15.049 --> 00:15:16.582
I will not take this abuse.

00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:18.398
You're right. I'm sorry..

00:15:19.317 --> 00:15:21.325
Once I was a wooden boy
A little wooden boy

00:15:25.866 --> 00:15:28.207
How are you doing today?
You sleep okay?

00:15:28.756 --> 00:15:30.595
Did you talk to Barry?
I can't stop smiling.

00:15:31.991 --> 00:15:34.652
I see that. You look like you
slept with a hanger in your mouth.

00:15:40.871 --> 00:15:42.684
I know. He's just so--

00:15:44.535 --> 00:15:45.729
Remember you and Tony De Marco?

00:15:47.139 --> 00:15:48.857
Well, it's like that.
With feelings.

00:15:50.821 --> 00:15:52.432
-Are you in trouble!

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:57.820
I'm going to get up, go to work,
and not think about him all day.

00:15:59.778 --> 00:16:01.004
Or else I'm just going
to get up and go to work.

00:16:02.416 --> 00:16:03.977
-Wish me luck!
-What for?

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:07.154
I'm gonna go get one
of those job things.

00:16:14.876 --> 00:16:17.174
-Hey, Monica.
-Hey, Franny. Welcome back.

00:16:17.703 --> 00:16:19.321
How was Florida?

00:16:19.743 --> 00:16:20.731
You had sex, didn't you?

00:16:21.485 --> 00:16:24.574
How do you do that?

00:16:24.909 --> 00:16:26.321
So, who?

00:16:26.933 --> 00:16:28.102
You know Paul?

00:16:28.864 --> 00:16:29.984
Paul, the wine guy?

00:16:30.896 --> 00:16:31.930
Yeah, I know Paul.

00:16:34.142 --> 00:16:36.526
You mean, you know Paul
like I know Paul?

00:16:37.244 --> 00:16:38.981
Are you kidding?
I take credit for Paul.

00:16:39.519 --> 00:16:42.660
Before me, there was no snap in his
turtle for two years.

00:16:46.831 --> 00:16:47.680
Of course it was a line.

00:16:49.621 --> 00:16:51.384
Why? Why would anybody
do something like that?

00:16:52.071 --> 00:16:54.593
We're looking for an answer
more sophisticated than. . .

00:16:55.221 --> 00:16:56.273
. . . ''To get you into bed. ''

00:16:58.308 --> 00:16:59.387
Is it me?

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:03.298
Is it like I have some sort of
beacon that only dogs. . .

00:17:03.681 --> 00:17:05.249
. . .and men with emotional
problems can hear?

00:17:06.266 --> 00:17:07.642
Come here.
Give me your feet.

00:17:15.064 --> 00:17:16.788
I just thought he was
nice, you know?

00:17:19.236 --> 00:17:21.975
I can't believe you
didn't know it was a line.

00:17:26.713 --> 00:17:27.340
Guess what?

00:17:27.876 --> 00:17:29.275
-You got a job?
-Are you kidding?

00:17:29.675 --> 00:17:31.000
I'm trained for nothing.

00:17:33.239 --> 00:17:34.363
I was laughed out of 12 interviews.

00:17:35.597 --> 00:17:36.650
You're surprisingly upbeat.

00:17:37.046 --> 00:17:39.765
You would be too if you found
Joan and David boots on sale. . .

00:17:40.516 --> 00:17:41.408
. . .50% percent off.

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:44.361
How well you know me.

00:17:45.734 --> 00:17:47.884
They're my, ''I don't need
a job or my parents.

00:17:48.305 --> 00:17:49.523
I've got great boots,'' boots.

00:17:51.385 --> 00:17:53.395
-How did you pay for them?
-Credit card.

00:17:54.294 --> 00:17:55.412
And who pays for that?

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:58.081
My father.

00:18:00.593 --> 00:18:02.520
You can't live off your parents.

00:18:03.036 --> 00:18:05.757
I know that. That's why
I was getting married.

00:18:06.887 --> 00:18:09.363
Give her a break. It's hard being
on your own for the first time.

00:18:09.908 --> 00:18:11.430
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

00:18:11.987 --> 00:18:14.012
When I first came to
this city, I was 1 4.

00:18:14.352 --> 00:18:16.503
My mom had killed herself
and my stepdad was in prison.

00:18:17.169 --> 00:18:19.122
And I got here,
and I didn't know anybody.

00:18:19.654 --> 00:18:23.853
I ended up living with this albino
guy who was cleaning windshields.

00:18:24.143 --> 00:18:27.519
And then he killed himself.

00:18:27.999 --> 00:18:31.381
Then I found aromatherapy. Believe
me, I know exactly how you feel.

00:18:35.001 --> 00:18:36.271
The word you're looking for is:

00:18:37.966 --> 00:18:39.525
''Anyway. . . . ''

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.623
You ready?

00:18:45.007 --> 00:18:45.949
-I don't think so.

00:18:46.237 --> 00:18:51.281
Cut, cut, cut.

00:18:54.906 --> 00:18:56.915
Welcome to the real world!

00:18:57.426 --> 00:18:59.009
It sucks.
You're gonna love it.

00:19:06.239 --> 00:19:07.399
That's it.

00:19:08.927 --> 00:19:10.020
You gonna crash on the couch?

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:12.902
-No, I gotta go home sometime.
-Are you gonna be okay?

00:19:15.675 --> 00:19:17.508
Look what I just
found on the floor.

00:19:19.613 --> 00:19:20.646
What?

00:19:21.662 --> 00:19:22.769
That's Paul's watch.

00:19:23.538 --> 00:19:25.055
You can just put it back
where you found it.

00:19:26.919 --> 00:19:28.192
Oh, boy! All right.

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:30.406
-Good night, everybody.
-Good night.

00:19:41.887 --> 00:19:43.045
-I'm sorry.
-No!

00:19:44.693 --> 00:19:45.415
-No, have it, really.
-Split it?

00:19:50.755 --> 00:19:53.608
You probably didn't know this,
but back in high school I had. . .

00:19:54.842 --> 00:19:55.593
. . .a major crush on you.

00:19:57.742 --> 00:19:58.554
I knew.

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:00.033
You did?

00:20:01.946 --> 00:20:04.585
I figured you thought I was
Monica's geeky older brother.

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:06.289
I did.

00:20:12.074 --> 00:20:12.869
Listen, do you think--

00:20:13.618 --> 00:20:17.039
And try not to let my vulnerability
become any kind of a factor here.

00:20:19.141 --> 00:20:20.377
Do you think it would be okay if
I asked you out sometime, maybe?

00:20:26.021 --> 00:20:26.866
Maybe.

00:20:35.051 --> 00:20:36.059
Okay, maybe I will.

00:20:40.739 --> 00:20:41.853
-Good night.
-Good night.

00:20:56.252 --> 00:20:57.142
See you.

00:20:59.235 --> 00:21:00.061
Wait, wait.

00:21:00.784 --> 00:21:01.825
What's with you?

00:21:03.872 --> 00:21:05.399
I just grabbed a spoon.

00:21:14.452 --> 00:21:17.448
I can't believe what
I'm hearing.

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:19.587
-What? I said you had--
-What? I said you had--

00:21:21.025 --> 00:21:21.775
Would you stop?

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:23.523
Was I doing it again?

00:21:25.934 --> 00:21:27.369
Would anybody like more coffee?

00:21:30.241 --> 00:21:31.737
Did you make it?

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:34.800
-I'm just serving it.
-I'll have a cup of coffee.

00:21:36.018 --> 00:21:37.501
Kids, new dream.

00:21:37.941 --> 00:21:39.022
I'm in Las Vegas.

00:21:39.325 --> 00:21:40.348
I'm Liza Minnelli.
